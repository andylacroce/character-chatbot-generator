# Character Chatbot Generator

A Next.js app featuring a real-time chat interface, character personas, and voice responses via Google Text-to-Speech.

## Features

- Voice responses via Google TTS
- Chat powered by OpenAI's ChatGPT
- Built with Next.js & React
- TypeScript throughout
- Comprehensive Jest test suite
- Responsive, accessible design
- HTML chat transcripts with character images (opens in new tabs)
- Logging to Vercel Blob or local file system
- **All internal API endpoints are public by default**

## Project structure

- `app/` - Next.js app & components
- `pages/api/` - API routes (chat, logging, health, transcript, audio)
- `src/` - Middleware, types, utilities (TTS, logger, cache, etc.)
- `tests/` - Test files for API, components, and utilities

## How it works

1. **Character Creation**: Users create a chatbot persona by entering a name or choosing a random character. The app generates a personality, avatar, and voice configuration.

   **Direct Character Creation via URL**: You can also create a character directly by including a `name` query parameter in the URL. For example: `https://your-domain.com/?name=Sherlock%20Holmes`. This will:
   - Load the character creation page (even if a character already exists)
   - Prepopulate the name field with the specified character
   - Automatically start generating the character

2. **Chat**: Users chat in real time. The app sends messages to OpenAI's API, receives characterful replies, and synthesizes voice responses using Google TTS.
3. **Transcript & Logging**: Users can view chat transcripts as formatted HTML pages with character images in new browser tabs. All chats can be logged to Vercel Blob or the local file system.

## Transcript Feature

The app provides a rich HTML transcript feature that opens in new browser tabs:

- **Format**: Clean HTML with responsive styling and character avatars
- **Access**: Click the transcript button in the chat header to open in a new tab
- **Filename**: Browser tab title shows "{Character Name} transcript {datetime}"
- **Content**: Includes all chat messages with proper formatting and character images
- **Browser Compatibility**: Works on all modern browsers (may be blocked by popup blockers)

## Setup (local)

1. **Clone & install**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/andylacroce/character-chatbot-generator.git
   cd character-chatbot-generator
   npm install
   ```

2. **Environment variables**

   - Create `.env.local` for local development (example):

   ```ini
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS_JSON=config/gcp-key.json
   VERCEL_BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN=your_vercel_blob_token_here
   ```

   - For Vercel, paste the full JSON string for `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS_JSON` and your `VERCEL_BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` in the Project Settings (see "Deployment" notes below).

3. **Middleware / CORS**

   - The file `middleware.ts` restricts API access to specific origins for security. If you run the app locally on a different port/domain or deploy to another Vercel project, update the `allowedOrigins` array in `middleware.ts`.

   Example:

   ```ts
   const allowedOrigins = [
     'http://localhost:3000',
     'http://127.0.0.1:3000',
     'https://your-custom-domain.com',
   ];
   ```

4. **Run locally**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Run tests**

   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

## Testing notes

- The project includes a small manual Jest mock for the `uuid` package at `__mocks__/uuid.js`.
  - Why: `uuid@13+` is ESM and contains `export` syntax. Transforming ESM node_modules can complicate Jest/Babel config. The mock is a small CommonJS-compatible shim used only for tests to keep them deterministic.
  - How to remove the mock:
    1. Configure Babel/Jest to transform `uuid` (the project already whitelists `uuid` in `transformIgnorePatterns`, but you may need to tweak Babel), or
    2. Pin `uuid` to a CJS-compatible release (not recommended), or
    3. Replace the mock with a test helper that uses a CJS-safe UUID generator.

## Deployment (Vercel)

- This app runs on Vercel. Provide secrets via Project Settings (Environment Variables):
  - `OPENAI_API_KEY`
  - `VERCEL_BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` (if using Vercel Blob)
  - `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS_JSON` â€” paste the full service-account JSON as a secret (do not commit `config/gcp-key.json`)
- Ensure server-side API routes that use Node-only SDKs (Google client libraries) are not configured as Edge functions (use the default Node runtime).
- Set a Node engine (>=18) in `package.json` or in Vercel settings if needed.
