# This workflow runs Jest tests on pull requests and pushes to main or master branches.
#
# How it works:
# - Triggers on pull requests and pushes to main or master.
# - Checks out the code and sets up Node.js 20.
# - Installs dependencies with npm ci.
# - Runs linting and type checking.
# - Runs all tests with coverage using npm test.
# - Uploads the coverage report as an artifact.
# - Fails the workflow if any step fails.
#
# Use this workflow to ensure code quality and prevent merging code that breaks tests.
